# ndgo Privacy Policy

Effective: March 15, 2024

At ndgo, we are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about the information we collect and how we use it. This Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand what data we collect, why we collect it, and how you can manage your information when using our service at ndgo.io. 

We've written this policy as clearly as possible, but we understand that privacy policies can sometimes be complex and lengthy due to legal requirements. We encourage you to read through this document in its entirety to fully understand our practices, but if you don't have time, the key points are:

1. We collect minimal personal information â€“ just your Google account info and username at signup.
2. The content you post on ndgo is public and may be used to display relevant ads to you.
3. We do not sell your personal information to anyone, ever.
4. You have control over your information and can delete your account at any time.
5. We are based in the U.S. and comply with applicable U.S. laws.

Now, let's dive into the details!

When you sign up for ndgo, we collect your Google account information (email address and profile name) and your chosen ndgo username. We do this to create and manage your account, and to communicate with you about your use of our service. We do not collect any other personal information, such as your real name, phone number, or physical address.

#### 1.1.2 User-Generated Content
ndgo is a public platform where users can share and interact with content. Any content you create, post, or share on ndgo, such as posts, comments, likes, and messages, is collected and stored by us.

### 1.2 Information We Collect Automatically

#### 1.2.1 Usage Data
When you interact with ndgo, we collect certain information automatically to understand how our service is being used and to make improvements. This includes your IP address, browser type, operating system, device information, pages visited, links clicked, and actions taken on the site. 

We may also collect information about your interactions with our email communications to understand open and click rates and to provide more relevant information to you.

#### 1.2.2 Cookies and Similar Technologies  
We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to collect and store information about your use of ndgo. Cookies are small data files stored on your device that allow us to recognize you when you return to our site and to personalize your experience. 

You can control cookies through your browser settings, but note that disabling cookies may affect your ability to use certain features of ndgo.

### 1.3 Analytics and Advertising
We use third-party analytics services, such as those provided by Vercel and Firebase, to help us understand how ndgo is being used. These services may collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including cookies and your IP address. 

The information collected is aggregated and anonymized, meaning it cannot be used to identify you personally. We use this data to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movements around the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

We reserve the right to use the information we collect, including user-generated content, to display advertisements that are relevant to you. This helps us keep ndgo free for all users. The information used for advertising purposes may include the content you post, your activity on ndgo, and your interactions with advertisements.

Vercel and Firebase's handling of analytics data is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by this policy.

User-generated content, such as posts and comments, may remain on ndgo and be accessible to other users even after you delete your account. This is because other users may have interacted with or shared your content, and we have no control over their use of the content.

However, as noted earlier, content that has been shared or interacted with by other users may remain on the site.

### 5.3 Cookies and Tracking Technologies
Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually set your browser to remove or reject cookies. Please note that removing or rejecting cookies may affect your ability to use certain features of ndgo.

For more information on how to manage cookies and other tracking technologies, please see our Cookie Policy.

## 6. Data Security
We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.

We encourage you to take steps to protect your personal information, such as choosing a strong password and not sharing your account credentials with others.

## 7. Children's Privacy

ndgo is based in the United States and the information we collect is processed and stored in the U.S. By using ndgo, you acknowledge and consent to the transfer and processing of your information in the U.S.

The U.S. may have different data protection laws than your country of residence. However, we take steps to ensure that your information is protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable laws.
