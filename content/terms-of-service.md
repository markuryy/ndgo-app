# ndgo Terms of Service

## Summary of our Terms

These Terms of Service ("Terms") are part of the User Agreement - a legally binding contract governing your use of ndgo. You should read these Terms in full, but here are a few key things you should take away:

- **Advertising on the platform**: In exchange for accessing the Services, ndgo and our third-party providers and partners may display advertising to you.
- **Compliance with User Agreement and Applicable Law**: When posting Content and using the Services, you must comply with this User Agreement and Applicable Law. You are responsible for your use of the Services and your Content.
- **Acceptable use terms**: You may not access the Services in any way other than through the currently available, published interfaces that we provide.
- **Enforcement rights**: ndgo reserves the right to take enforcement actions against you if you violate these terms, including removing your Content, limiting visibility, discontinuing your access, or taking legal action. We may also suspend or terminate your account for reasons such as prolonged inactivity, risk of legal exposure, or commercial inviability.
- **Intellectual Property Licenses**: You retain ownership and rights to your Content you post or share, and you provide us with a broad, royalty-free license to make your Content available and let others do the same. We provide you a license to use the software as part of the Services.
- **Use at your own risk**: We provide the Services on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis, and we disclaim all warranties, responsibility, and liability to you or others to the extent permitted by law. You may be exposed to offensive or harmful content posted by other users.
- **Remedies and redress mechanisms**: You may terminate this agreement at any time by deactivating your account. Our aggregate liability shall not exceed the greater of $100 USD or the amount you paid us, if any, in the past six months for the Services giving rise to the claim.

Please also note that these Terms incorporate our Privacy Policy (https://ndgo.io/privacy) as well as other terms applicable to your use of the Services and your Content. You must be at least 18 years old to use ndgo.

The ndgo User Agreement comprises these Terms of Service, our Privacy Policy, our Rules and Policies, and all incorporated policies.

By using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

### 1. Who May Use the Services

You may use the Services only if you agree to form a binding contract with us and are not a person barred from receiving services under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction. In any case, you must be at least 18 years old to use the Services. If you are accepting these Terms and using the Services on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to bind such entity to these Terms.

### 2. Privacy

Our Privacy Policy (https://www.ndgo.io/privacy) describes how we handle the information you provide to us when you use the Services. You understand that through your use of the Services, you consent to the collection and use of this information, including the transfer of this information to the United States, Ireland, and/or other countries for storage, processing, and use by us and our affiliates.

### 3. Content on the Services

You are responsible for your use of the Services and for any Content you provide, including compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations. You should only provide Content that you are comfortable sharing with others.

We reserve the right to remove Content that violates the User Agreement, including for example, copyright or trademark violations or other intellectual property misappropriation, impersonation, unlawful conduct, or harassment.

By submitting, posting, or displaying Content on or through the Services, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display, and distribute such Content in any and all media or distribution methods now known or later developed. You agree that this license includes the right for us to provide, promote, and improve the Services and to make Content submitted to or through the Services available to other companies, organizations, or individuals for the syndication, broadcast, distribution, repost, promotion, or publication of such Content on other media and services. You represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant this license for any Content you submit.

### 4. Using the Services

You may use the Services only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. ndgo takes enforcement actions when Content or user behavior is in violation of our Rules and Policies or in relation to sensitive media. You can review ndgo's enforcement options and how you can appeal our enforcement decision.

The Services evolve constantly. As such, the Services may change from time to time, at our discretion. We may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services or any features within the Services to you or to users generally. We also retain the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time. We may also remove or refuse to distribute any Content on the Services, limit distribution or visibility of any Content on the service, suspend or terminate users, and reclaim usernames without liability to you.

In consideration for our granting you access to and use of the Services, you agree that we and our third-party providers and partners may place advertising on the Services or in connection with the display of Content or information from the Services, whether submitted by you or others. We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is necessary to satisfy legal requirements, enforce the Terms, detect and address fraud or security issues, and protect the rights, property, or safety of ndgo, its users, and the public.

Furthermore, you agree not to misuse the Services, for example, by interfering with them or accessing them using a method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide. You agree that you will not work around any technical limitations in the software provided to you as part of the Services, or reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, except and only to the extent that applicable law expressly permits. You also agree not to access, tamper with, or use non-public areas of the Services, our computer systems, or the technical delivery systems of our providers, or attempt to probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any system or network or breach any security or authentication measures.

### 5. Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability

Your access to and use of the Services or any Content is at your own risk. The Services are provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the ndgo entities disclaim all warranties and conditions, express or implied, of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

The ndgo entities shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues resulting from your access to or use of the Services. In no event shall the aggregate liability of the ndgo entities exceed the greater of $100 or the amount you paid to us, if any, in the past six months for the Services giving rise to the claim.

### 6. General

We may revise these Terms from time to time. The changes will not be retroactive, and the most current version of the Terms will govern our relationship with you. We will try to notify you of material revisions, for example, via a service notification or email. By continuing to access or use the Services after revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms. You also waive the right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action proceeding, to the extent permitted by law.

The laws of the State of New York, excluding its choice of law provisions, will govern these Terms and any dispute that arises between you and us. All disputes related to these Terms or the Services will be brought solely in the federal or state courts located in Erie County, New York.

The ndgo User Agreement is written in English. However, in case of any discrepancies or inconsistencies, the English version shall take precedence. You acknowledge that English shall be the language of reference for interpreting and constructing the terms of the ndgo User Agreement.

In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision.
